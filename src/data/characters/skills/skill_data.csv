missile_specialization,Missile Specialization,0,"Missile systems are a world unto themselves. An expert can override many safety parameters, getting a significant increase in performance as a result.",graphics/icons/skills/missile_specialization.png
ordnance_expert,Ordnance Expertise,10,Following proper maintenance protocols can both reduce the support profile of weapon systems and increase their combat performance.,graphics/icons/skills/ordnance_expert.png
damage_control,Damage Control,20,Even ships built from blueprints can be jury-rigged to a great extent. The right adjustments can limit the extent of combat damage and allow it to be repaired more easily.,graphics/icons/skills/damage_control.png
target_analysis,Target Analysis,30,"Properly interpreting often conflicting data from sensors, targeting modules and recommendations from adaptive tactical analysis systems is as more an art than an exact science.",graphics/icons/skills/target_analysis.png
evasive_action,Evasive Action,40,"Even if incoming fire cannot be completely avoided, the pilot often has a choice in just where the damage is taken.",graphics/icons/skills/evasive_maneuvering.png
helmsmanship,Helmsmanship,50,The factory redline for an engine is set to the highest safe level - given variations within production runs from the same blueprint. An intuitive feel for the behavior of a specific engine allows a skilled pilot to push it much farther.,graphics/icons/skills/helmsmanship.png
flux_modulation,Power Grid Modulation,60,Preventive maintenance and some inspired on-the-fly adjustments can greatly increase the capacity of the ship's power grid.,graphics/icons/skills/power_grid_manipulation.png

#coordinated_maneuvers,Coordinated Maneuvers,90,"Constant drills - and refined navigation protocols - allow ships to anticipate the movements of their allies, and let a fleet maneuver smoothly as a whole.",graphics/icons/skills/coordinated_maneuvers.png
advanced_tactics,Advanced Tactics,100,Hard-won experience - as well as poring over tactical manuals and battle reports - allow the commander to formulate and carry out more advanced battle plans.,graphics/icons/skills/advanced_tactics.png
command_experience,Command Experience,110,Knowing when to delegate responsibility - and giving one's subordinates the opportunity to excel - produces more capable and loyal crews.,graphics/icons/skills/command_experience.png
fleet_logistics,Fleet Logistics,120,"Managing the support requirements for a fleet can be a nightmare. Breakdowns are increasingly common throughout the Sector, and in deep space, a single missing spare part can spell disaster.",graphics/icons/skills/fleet_logistics.png

gunnery_implants,Gunnery Implants,150,"Over time, the augmented reality presented by the implants becomes more and more difficult to distinguish from normal sensory input. Dedicated gunners often feel more kinship with their ship than they do with their crewmates.",graphics/icons/skills/gunnery_implants.png
applied_physics,Applied Physics,160,"A baseline knowledge of physics, though not enough to create the technology from scratch, is required to make some of the modifications to ship systems.",graphics/icons/skills/applied_physics.png
flux_dynamics,Flux Dynamics,170,"Though much of the knowledge was lost in the Collapse, blueprint-manufactured tech still lends itself to the same experimental approach that the underlying scientific principles do. An expert in flux dynamics may not know ""why"", but they know ""how"".",graphics/icons/skills/flux_dynamics.png
computer_systems,Computer Systems,180,"While the manufacture of sophisticated hardware without blueprints is impossible, software modification is state-of-the-art in the Sector - both because of high demand to adapt existing systems for different tasks, and the relative ease of experimentation.",graphics/icons/skills/computer_systems.png
construction,Construction,190,"Whether it's welding additional armor plates onto a hull, or putting prefab building parts together, a lot of work still gets done the old-fashioned way - by a spacesuited human being wielding power tools or controlling heavy machinery.",graphics/icons/skills/construction.png
mechanical_engineering,Mechanical Engineering,200,Stand-alone components and replacement parts can be manufactured using portable mini-forges or blueprint-assisted tools. A good engineer is an expert in both the manufacturing process and in the integration of these components with existing systems.,graphics/icons/skills/mechanical_engineering.png
field_repairs,Field Repairs,220,"Creative re-purposing of existing components and jury-rigging systems seemingly beyond repair are par for the course for any engineer, whether they're repairing extensive battle damage or making ship modifications in the field.",graphics/icons/skills/field_repairs.png
navigation,Navigation,230,"Gravitational fields, as well as some poorly-understood forces acting on the drive anchor in p-space, both require careful analysis to minimize their interference with the drive field.",graphics/icons/skills/navigation.png
